## About
Boxento is inspired by the need for a flexible dashboard for developers, sysadmins, and tech enthusiasts who live online. The goal is to keep it lightweight, open-source, and community-driven with support for both local widgets and third-party integrations.

## Features
- **Lightweight & Modular**: Built with React + Vite for fast, minimal performance, using Vite as the industry-standard build tool and Bun for package management and runtime.
- **Modern UI Components**: Utilizes shadcn/ui for beautiful, accessible, and consistent UI elements.
- **Resizable Widgets**: Drag, drop, and resize all widgets to show more or less information (e.g., Calendar shows month overview at 2x2, full calendar at 6x6).
- **Theme Support**: All widgets support both light and dark modes, toggled via a sun icon in the top-right corner.
- **Open-Source Friendly**: MIT-licensed, easy for anyone to contribute widgets.
- **UX-Focused**: Intuitive drag-and-drop, keyboard shortcuts (cmd + k for widget picker), and clean aesthetics.
- **High Performance**: Optimized with Vite's tree-shaking and lazy loading, ensuring fast load times even with resizable widgets.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Bun (v1.0+ or latest, see [bun.sh](https://bun.sh))
- Git (optional, for cloning/forking)

### Installation
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sushaantu/boxento.git
cd boxento
```

Install dependencies with Bun:
```bash
bun install
```

Boxento uses shadcn/ui components, which are already included in the project. Vite is the build tool, handling development and production builds seamlessly. If you need to add additional shadcn/ui components, use the shadcn-ui CLI:

```bash
bunx shadcn-ui@latest add [component-name]
```

For example, to add the Dialog component:
```bash
bunx shadcn-ui@latest add dialog
```

Check the components.json file in the project root to see installed shadcn/ui components and their configurations.

### Running Locally
Start the development server with Bun, which runs Vite:
```bash
bun run dev
```

Open your browser to http://localhost:5173 (Vite's default port). Vite provides fast hot module replacement (HMR) for rapid development.

## Usage
- **Homepage**: Land on "You can add widgets" with a button to add built-in widgets.
- **Widgets**: Drag and resize tiles to fit your workflow—larger sizes (up to 6x6) show more details, while the standard 2x2 size shows essential information.
- **Settings**: Click the gear icon on a widget for basic settings (e.g., location for Weather), stored in localStorage.
- **Theme Toggle**: Switch between light and dark modes using the sun icon in the top-right corner, stored in localStorage. This toggles the entire screen and all widgets, ensuring consistent theming across Boxento.

## Widgets

### Built-in Widgets
Boxento comes with these widgets:

- **Calendar**: Shows today's date and events
- **Weather**: Displays local weather
- **World Clocks**: Shows times in multiple timezones
- **Quick Links**: Editable grid of clickable bookmarks
- **Notes**: A minimalist notepad for capturing thoughts and ideas

### Creating Your Own Widgets
Boxento is open-source, and anyone can create and contribute widgets! For detailed instructions, see our [Widget Development Guide](docs/WIDGET_DEVELOPMENT.md).

Here's a quick overview of the process:

1. **Fork the Repository**:
   - Visit github.com/sushaantu/boxento and click "Fork."

2. **Clone Your Fork**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sushaantu/boxento.git
   cd boxento
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

4. **Create a Widget**:
   - Follow the template and guidelines in the [Widget Development Guide](docs/WIDGET_DEVELOPMENT.md)
   - Remember that all widgets must have a minimum size of 2x2 and maximum size of 6x6
   - Ensure your widget supports both light and dark themes

5. **Test Locally**:
   - Run `bun run dev` and test your widget thoroughly

6. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**:
   - Create a PR on GitHub against `sushaantu/boxento:main`, including a description, testing steps, and screenshots if possible

See [Contributing](#contributing) and [Design Guidelines](#design-guidelines) for additional details.

### Resizable Widgets
All widgets are resizable with react-grid-layout:

- **Size Constraints**: All widgets have a minimum size of 2x2 grid units and a maximum size of 6x6 grid units
- **Responsive Content**: Widgets adapt their content based on size—smaller sizes show essential information, larger sizes show more details
- **Size Persistence**: Widget sizes are stored in localStorage for persistence
- **Size Enforcement**: The application enforces the minimum 2x2 size constraint for all widgets

For detailed information about widget sizing and development, see the [Widget Development Guide](docs/WIDGET_DEVELOPMENT.md).

## Package Management

Boxento uses [Bun](https://bun.sh/) as its primary package manager. Bun offers faster installation times and improved performance compared to npm or yarn.

### Using Bun

To install dependencies:
```bash
bun install
```

To run scripts:
```bash
bun run dev     # Start development server
bun run build   # Build for production
bun run preview # Preview production build
bun run typecheck # Run TypeScript type checking
```

### Package Management Standards

- Use Bun exclusively for all package management operations
- Do not commit package-lock.json, yarn.lock, or pnpm-lock.yaml files
- Always use `bun run` to execute scripts defined in package.json
- When adding new dependencies, use `bun add [package]`
- For dev dependencies, use `bun add -d [package]`

### Hosting Yourself
Build the static site:
```bash
bun run build
```
This generates a `dist/` folder with HTML, CSS, and JS.

Host locally (for testing):
- Install serve with Bun: `bun add -g serve`
- Run: `serve -s dist` and access at http://localhost:3000

Host on GitHub Pages (recommended):
- Push to GitHub, set up a GitHub Action in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` to build and deploy `dist/`:
```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v1
      - run: bun install
      - run: bun run build  # Uses Vite for building the static site
      - uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: dist
```
- Enable GitHub Pages in repo settings (gh-pages branch, /root directory)
- Access at https://sushaantu.github.io/boxento

### Hosting for Contributors
Contributors can host their fork similarly:

- Build: `bun run build`
- Host on GitHub Pages (as above) or locally with serve

## Contributing
We welcome contributions to Boxento! Follow these steps:

### Pull Request Process
1. Fork and clone the repo (see [Creating Your Own Widgets](#creating-your-own-widgets))
2. Create a widget or fix in `/src/components/widgets/` or elsewhere
3. Test locally with `bun run dev`
4. Commit and push to your fork
5. Create a PR on GitHub against `main`, including:

   - Description (purpose, features, testing steps, screenshots if possible)
   - Ensure no breaking changes to existing code

### Approval Criteria
PRs are reviewed and approved based on:

- **Functionality**: Works with React + Vite, integrates with `react-grid-layout` (draggable, resizable), handles `width`/`height` props
- **Theme Support**: Properly supports both light and dark modes, toggled via the sun icon (use Tailwind's `dark:` classes)
- **Design Aesthetic**: Matches Boxento's style (see [Design Guidelines](#design-guidelines))
- **Component Usage**: Uses shadcn/ui components for UI elements where appropriate
- **Code Quality**: Follows React best practices, uses Tailwind CSS, no unnecessary dependencies, and ensures compatibility with Vite's build process
- **Documentation**: Includes a PR description and updates `/docs` if needed
- **Performance & Accessibility**: Lightweight, accessible (ARIA labels, keyboard nav if interactive), optimized with Vite's tree-shaking

Expect feedback within 1-3 days—update your PR based on comments, and it'll be merged if criteria are met.

### Design Guidelines
All widgets must follow Boxento's aesthetic for consistency:

- **Component Library**: Use shadcn/ui components for standard UI elements (buttons, inputs, modals, etc.).
- **Typography**: Use the Inter font throughout the application.
- **Borders**: Use a consistent 8px radius (Tailwind `rounded-lg`) and 1px shadow (Tailwind `shadow`) for all widgets.
- **Colors**: Use semantic color classes (e.g., `bg-white dark:bg-gray-800`, `text-black dark:text-white`) that work seamlessly with both light and dark modes.
- **Theming**: All widgets must support both light and dark modes using Tailwind's `dark:` prefix. The theme is toggled via a sun icon (or moon icon) in the top-right corner, using shadcn/ui components.
- **Spacing**: Use 16px padding (`p-4`) inside widgets and 8px margins between tiles (handled by `react-grid-layout`).
- **Animations**: Keep animations minimal—use Tailwind hover effects (`hover:shadow-md`) or transitions (`transition-all duration-200`) for resize/drag interactions.
- **Responsiveness**: Adjust content dynamically for different sizes (2x2 minimum to 6x6 maximum) based on `width` and `height` props, ensuring readability and usability at all supported sizes.
