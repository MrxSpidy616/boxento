- Use Tailwind CSS classes exclusively for styling
- Follow utility-first CSS methodology
- Avoid creating custom CSS files unless absolutely necessary
- Use Tailwind's @apply directive for reusable styles in components
- Maintain consistent spacing and layout using Tailwind's spacing scale
- Use Tailwind's color palette for consistency
- Support dark mode with Tailwind's dark: variant
- Extract common class combinations into reusable React components
- Use CSS variables (via Tailwind) for theming when appropriate
- For complex animations, use framer-motion library with Tailwind classes
- Place responsive design variants in a consistent order (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:)
- Group related utility classes together (spacing, colors, typography)
