# Todo Widget

A clean, minimalist to-do list widget that helps you organize tasks and boost productivity. The widget provides an intuitive interface for managing tasks with essential features while maintaining a focused, distraction-free design.

## Design Philosophy

The Todo widget follows these design principles:

- **Simplicity**: Clean interface focusing on the primary task management functions
- **Usability**: Intuitive interactions for adding, completing, and removing tasks
- **Adaptability**: Customizable appearance and behavior to fit user preferences
- **Persistence**: Automatically saves changes to maintain task state between sessions

## Features

- Add, complete, and delete tasks with simple interactions
- Visual indication of task completion status
- Customizable sorting options (by creation date, alphabetical, or completion status)
- Option to show or hide completed tasks
- Clean, accessible design that works well in both light and dark modes
- Responsive layout that adapts to different widget sizes

## Usage

The Todo widget can be added to your dashboard through the widget picker. Once added, you can:

1. Add tasks by typing in the input field and pressing Enter or clicking the plus button
2. Mark tasks as complete/incomplete by clicking the circle button
3. Delete tasks by hovering over a task and clicking the trash icon
4. Access settings by clicking the settings icon in the widget header

## Settings

The Todo widget provides customization options through its settings panel:

- **Title**: Change the widget header text
- **Sort Order**: Choose how tasks are sorted (by creation date, alphabetically, or by completion status)
- **Show Completed Items**: Toggle visibility of completed tasks

## Implementation Details

### File Structure

- `index.tsx`: Main component implementing the widget functionality
- `types.ts`: TypeScript type definitions for the widget
- `README.md`: Documentation (this file)

### State Management

The widget maintains its state in the following ways:

1. Local state for UI interactions using React's useState hook
2. Persisted state through the widget's config object and onUpdate callback

### Data Flow

1. User actions trigger state updates in the component
2. Updates are persisted to the parent component via onUpdate callback
3. Configuration changes are applied to the UI

## One-Shot Development Checklist

For successful one-shot widget development, ensure:

- [x] Widget follows the project's component pattern
- [x] All required files are created (index.tsx, types.ts, README.md)
- [x] Widget is properly exported and registered in the widget registry
- [x] Widget handles both light and dark themes
- [x] Widget responds appropriately to resizing
- [x] Widget maintains state correctly (local and persistent)
- [x] Documentation is complete with features, usage, and implementation details

## Lessons Learned

During implementation, we identified and fixed several issues that are crucial for successful widget development:

1. **Background Styling**: Always include proper background styling (`bg-white dark:bg-gray-800`) for the widget container to ensure it doesn't appear transparent.

2. **Border Radius Consistency**: Use the correct border radius (`rounded-xl`) to match other widgets in the application. Inconsistent border radii create visual discord.

3. **Space Utilization**: Design with the 2x2 minimum size as the primary constraint. For small widgets, integrate input fields within the content area rather than placing them outside the main container.

4. **Layout Organization**: Use a proper layout structure with flexbox for optimal space usage:
   ```
   Widget Container
   ├── Header
   ├── Content Area (flex-grow, px-4 pb-4 pt-2)
   │   ├── Todo Items List (flex-grow)
   │   └── Input Form (integrated within content)
   └── Settings Dialog
   ```

5. **Resize Handle Clearance**: Always include sufficient bottom margin (`mb-3`) to prevent form elements from overlapping with the resize handle that appears on hover.

6. **Consistent Padding**: Follow the app's padding patterns (typically `px-4 pb-4 pt-2` for the main content area) to maintain visual consistency across widgets.

7. **Accessibility Considerations**: Ensure all interactive elements have proper aria labels and are easily accessible even in small widget sizes.

8. **Dialog Components**: Follow the project's pattern for dialog components, including the Delete Widget button in settings when applicable.

### Additional Considerations for Future Widgets

- Consider adding unit tests in a `__tests__` directory
- Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions to improve accessibility
- Consider internationalization support for multilingual environments
- Include animated transitions for improved user experience
