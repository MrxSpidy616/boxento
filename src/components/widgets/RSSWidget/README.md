## Display Modes

The RSS Widget supports three display modes:

- **List**: Shows items in a vertical list with optional images on the left
- **Cards**: Shows items as cards with images at the top (good for visual feeds)
- **Compact**: Shows only titles and dates in a minimal view (best for small widgets)

## Responsive Behavior

The widget automatically adapts to different sizes:

- In small 2x2 widgets, it always uses the Compact mode regardless of settings
- For larger widgets, it uses the selected display mode
- List and Card views adjust their layouts based on available space

## Example Feeds

You can use these example feeds to test the widget:

- Hacker News: `https://news.ycombinator.com/rss`
- New York Times: `https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml`
- Wired: `https://www.wired.com/feed/rss`

## Technical Details

The widget uses a CORS proxy to fetch RSS feeds from any source, parses the XML, and extracts all relevant information. It handles various RSS formats and looks for images in different tags including media:content, enclosure, and embedded images in content.
